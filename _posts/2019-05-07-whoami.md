Hey, Iâ€™m Ruanâ€Šâ€”â€Šan Engineer, Designer and Product Manager at [Pusher](https://pusher.com). I care deeply about UX, UI and delivering impactful work that is win-win for the business and our customers. Thatâ€™s why I work in a new cross functional team (agency-esque) called the *Workshop*â€Šâ€”â€Šour mission is:

> To support, elevate, and connect the ideas of others; to create and act as the custodians of the Pusher identity, and; to create powerful systems that inform and scale our impact.

On a daily basis, Iâ€™m having really thought provoking conversations (I would say that though, wouldnâ€™t I), and wanted to start sharing my thoughts on various subjects to trigger discussion, learn new things and allow my assumptions to be challenged.

Iâ€™ve never written a blog or shared my thoughts like this externally before, but I wanted to push myself to try something new. If nothing else, at least Iâ€™ll have a great documented list of ramblings to look back on ðŸ˜‚ .
