This has been a topic on my blog list for some time now, however, with COVID-19 it seems more important than ever.

Remote working can force great new ways of working and in my experience when done well, keeps meetings focused.

Don't get me wrong, doing remote working well is hard, it takes a shift in ways of working‚ÄîI think for the better‚Äîespecially for companies not set up for it.

Amidst this difficult time, maybe COVID-19 becomes a catalyst for driving remote working at more companies ü§ûin my opinion too many still focus on presenteeism.

Tips:
_Trust your team_
It goes without saying you should do this irrespective of being remote or not, however, some people will say things like ‚Äúwhat are they up to?‚Äù or ‚Äúthey‚Äôre not always online‚Äù.

In my experience, the people who ask these questions are typically not measuring success by outcomes but by output. If you haven‚Äôt already set some KPIs or OKRs or whatever works for your business but set some NOW! This is a whole other post topic I could talk about.

_Schedule your time_
It‚Äôs easy for people to feel pressured to show they are present. Hopefully, you have a trusting manager and team, so keep focused on your objectives and not how many hours you‚Äôre online.

It‚Äôs too easy for time to disappear too since there won‚Äôt be the typical human interruptions or social queues for lunch or grabbing a coffee etc. Schedule break time, practice the Pomodoro technique or some other time management techniques so you don‚Äôt get burnt out.

_Turn your video on_
Seeing a real person at the other end of a call makes a difference.

_Sounds stupid but turn your mic off when not speaking_
I can't tell you how many times people forget this and all you hear is them chomping away at a chocolate bar. It's impossible to hear each other and you get insanely jealous that you don't have one üòÇ

_Learn to turn your notifications off when in ‚Äúmeetings‚Äù_
In most meetings, I try not to have my laptop open and I take a notepad. However, now you‚Äôll be on your laptop 100% of the time. Learn to turn off your notifications so that you stay ‚Äúin the room‚Äù and aren‚Äôt distracted by constant email or slack notifications.

_Over communicate_
I can‚Äôt say this enough but over communicate everything. Write up meeting notes, send clarification messages and make time for personal updates.

_Make time for pleasantries_
Being remote can remove some of the human element out of communication. Take time to ask how people are and listen before you jump straight into work mode.

_Learn with your team_
Every team is different, we all work slightly differently but make time to discuss remote working techniques that you‚Äôd like to try.
Some simple things I‚Äôve done:

- Socialise virtually - create a meeting whose sole purpose is to catch up over coffee.
- Make sure there is one facilitator, who should ensure each person in the meeting has a say.
- Create a Google Doc for each meeting and have everyone collaborate on it in real-time.
- Make space for things to be parked; items that can be discussed later

_Get out the house_
Make time to get out of the house /where safe to do so/. Go for a walk and get some fresh air (_whilst following social distancing or your local advice_).

Working at home for extended periods can be hard if you‚Äôre not used to it, but create a routine and get some fresh air.

There are so many things you can try as an individual and as a team‚Äîtest, learn and adapt‚Ä¶.what other choice do we have?
