title: Why meetings still suck (and how AI might finally save us) 🤖

Anyone who knows me knows I love productivity and efficiency tools. My current favourite for meetings is Granola. It’s smart, simple, and actually helpful. But let’s be honest, there are a *lot* of tools like this right now, and most of them won’t survive.

In a world where companies are under pressure to do more with less, or work smarter with what they already have, the real winners in this space will need to do something that feels counterintuitive: **Help us have fewer, better meetings.**

## The silent killer of work

We’ve normalised a world where meetings are the default setting for getting anything done, and a lot of them are garbage. 

This is not just my view, it’s backed by data and quotes from people across roles and industries:
- Only 37% of meetings have an agenda
- 64% of recurring and 60% of one-off meetings happen without one
- Executives consider 67% of meetings a failure
- Individual contributors often spend half their week in meetings they didn’t ask for and don’t understand

> “I slack the organiser just to understand what it’s about.”  
> —IC PM, SMB  

> “We waste a lot of time scene-setting because the purpose wasn’t clear from the start.”  
> —Marketing Operator, Scale-up

We’re 25 years into the 21st century and still wasting huge amounts of time.

## Everyone’s building the same AI. That’s a problem.

There are at least two dozen products that transcribe your meetings, summarise what happened, and tag follow-ups. They wrap it in a clean UI, store it somewhere, and call it productivity.

The result? They just make it easier to have more of them 🤦‍♂️.

But none of them fix the actual problem:  
**The meeting itself is broken.**

## Better inputs = Better outputs

Language models don’t just need data. They need **context**. 

A study on how context affects LLM factual predictions showed that adding relevant information *significantly* improves model accuracy. AI isn’t magic. It just does better work when it knows what it’s supposed to focus on.

If your AI knows the meeting is a sales call, it can spotlight objections, buyer intent, and next steps. If it’s a design review, it’ll highlight feedback and action points.

But if there’s no title, no agenda, and no stated goal?  **AI is just guessing**.

## The missing link: Pre-meeting context

If we’re heading toward a world of agentic AI, where agents can perform tasks on our behalf, then we need to feed them better inputs.

So now imagine if your meeting assistant asked you:
- *“What’s the goal?”*
- *“Is this async-worthy?”*
- *“Why are these eight people invited?”*

It can become a gatekeeper. A nudger. A slightly passive-aggressive assistant that helps you set purpose and agenda before anyone clicks ‘Join.’

Now meetings are fewer, sharper, and structured so your AI agent actually knows what to do next.

## Final thoughts

AI tools are about to flood your calendar with summaries, tags, and follow-ups. But none of that matters if the meeting itself is broken.

The real frontier isn’t just post-processing. It’s pre-meeting clarity.

If we want AI to actually make work better, not just prettier, we need to teach it to ask the one question humans keep avoiding:

***“Why are we meeting at all?”***
